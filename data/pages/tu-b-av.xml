&lt;h4&gt;General Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tu B&#039;Av is a post-Biblical holiday, though its exact origins are unknown. It served as a matchmaking day in Second Temple times and is described in the Talmud as one of the year&#039;s happiest days: young Jewish women would dress in white and dance in the vineyards, and young bachelors would follow them in search of a bride. The holiday was revived in the modern state of Israel and is now celebrated as a day of love.&lt;/p&gt;
