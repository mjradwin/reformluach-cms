&lt;h4&gt;General Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tu B&#039;Sh&#039;vat is also called the new year for trees and is one of the four new years mentioned in Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 1:1. It is considered the time when trees begin a new fruit-bearing cycle after winter. For purposes of tithing, fruit harvested after Tu B&#039;Sh&#039;vat was considered as belonging to a new crop year. There is no established liturgy for Tu B&#039;Sh&#039;vat and there are not Mitzvot associated with it. There are many different customs and possible ways to observe Tu B&#039;Sh&#039;vat; customary observances include eating fruits grown in Israel, particularly the fruits mentioned in the Torah (e.g. grapes, figs, pomegranates), holding a Tu B&#039;Sh&#039;vat Seder, and planting trees in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
